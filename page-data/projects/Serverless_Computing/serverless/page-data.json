The second part truly is a never-ending task. Why not leave that part to someone else?</p>\n<h2>What is serverless computing?</h2>\n<p>Serverless computing is an execution model for the cloud in which a cloud provider dynamically allocates—and then charges the user for—only the compute resources and storage needed to execute a particular piece of code. Obviously servers are involved in the process but they are entirely mantained by the service provider.</p>\n<p>Serverless functions are event-driven, meaning the code is invoked only when triggered by a request. The provider charges only for compute time used by that execution, rather than a flat monthly fee for maintaining a physical or virtual server. These functions can be connected together to create a processing pipeline, or they can serve as components of a larger application, interacting with other code running in containers or on conventional servers.</p>\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\n<p>Developers can focus on the business goals of the code they write, rather than on infrastructural questions; and organizations only pay for the compute resources they actually use rather than on the whole infrastructure.</p>\n<p>One of the canonical examples of a serverless architecture use case is a service that uploads and processes a series of individual image files and sends them along to another part of the application.</p>\n<h2>Drawbacks</h2>\n<p>They are unsuitable for long-term tasks. Most serverless providers won’t let your code execute for more than a few minutes, and when you spin up a function, it doesn’t retain any stateful data from previously run instances. It may often become difficult to integrate serverless code into in-house development and testing pipelines.</p>\n<h2>Serverless vendors</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 900px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ea6a315c1f505bbdf2d5a66832d06769/1cfc2/vendors.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"serverless vendors\"\n        title=\"serverless vendors\"\n        src=\"/static/ea6a315c1f505bbdf2d5a66832d06769/1cfc2/vendors.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ea6a315c1f505bbdf2d5a66832d06769/8ff5a/vendors.png 240w,\n/static/ea6a315c1f505bbdf2d5a66832d06769/e85cb/vendors.png 480w,\n/static/ea6a315c1f505bbdf2d5a66832d06769/1cfc2/vendors.png 900w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The modern age of serverless computing began with the launch of AWS Lambda, a platform based on Amazon’s cloud service, in 2014.
