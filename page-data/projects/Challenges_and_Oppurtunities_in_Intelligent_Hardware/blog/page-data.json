Computer Vision</strong></h2>\n<p>Video is arguably the biggest of the big data. It accounts for over ** 70% ** of today’s Internet traffic . For instance, over 800 million hours of video is collected daily worldwide for video surveillance [6]. In many applications (e.g., measuring wait times in stores, traffic patterns), it would be desirable to use computer vision to extract the meaningful information from the video right at the image sensor rather than in the cloud to reduce the communication cost. For other applications such as autonomous vehicles, drone navigation and robotics, local processing is desired since the latency and security risk of relying on the cloud are too high. However, video involves a large amount of data, which is computationally complex to process; thus, low cost hardware to analyze video is challenging yet critical to enabling these applications. In computer vision, there are many different artificial intelligence (AI) tasks .\r\n<a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*Mn8VKKEW-3rv6opELKZl8A.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*Mn8VKKEW-3rv6opELKZl8A.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>B. Speech Recognition</strong></h2>\n<p>Speech recognition has significantly improved our ability to interact with electronic devices, such as smartphones. While currently most of the processing for applications such as Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa voice services is in the cloud, it is desirable to perform the recognition on the device itself to reduce latency and dependence on connectivity, and to increase privacy. Speech recognition is the first step before many other AI tasks such as machine translation, natural language processing, etc.\r\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*dNTIx78ATaFN-mn-.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2><strong>C. Medical</strong></h2>\n<p>There is a strong clinical need to be able to monitor patients and to collect long-term data to help either detect/diagnose various diseases or monitor treatment. For instance, constant monitoring of ECG or EEG signals would be helpful in identifying cardiovascular diseases or detecting the onset of a seizure for epilepsy patients, respectively.\r\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0*ahrWazH5xmkMGDK2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1><strong>The Challenges</strong></h1>\n<p>The key metrics for embedded machine learning are accuracy, energy consumption, throughput/latency, and cost. The accuracy of the machine learning algorithm should be measured on a sufficiently large dataset. Programmability is important since the weights need to be updated when the environment or application changes. In the case of deep neural networks, the processor must also be able to support different networks with varying number of layers, filters, channels and filter sizes.\r\nThe high dimensionality and need for programmability both result in an increase in computation and data movement. Higher dimensionality increases the amount of data generated and programmability means that the weights also need to be read and stored. This poses a challenge for energy-efficiency since data movement costs more than computation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/e0qSTX8\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y7ibZvv.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<h3>How do we go around managing such challenges?</h3>\n<p>One would be to employ highly parallel, superscalar and temporal architectures in both CPU and GPU formats for vector and scalar computation.

The global buffer communicates with the off-chip memory (e.g., DRAM). Data movement is allowed between the PEs using an on-chip network (NoC) to reduce access to the global buffer and the off-chip memory.
