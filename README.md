## Styling
The project is currently set up to support both CSS ans SASS. It is strongly recommended to use SASS always.
Use inline styling fot components if you can get away with it but feel free to make a separate SASS module and import it into your component.
Try not to duplicate the style properties use the power of inheritance!

Typography.js takes care of the fonts throughout the website see `src/utils/typography.js`. Predefined themes are also available for moe information refer to the [docs](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/)!


## Troubleshooting
I have not encountered any major error till now except this one
`Internal watch failed: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached`

Fix: `sudo echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`

Since this occurred fairly often I made an alias for this in my `.zshrc`

## Tutorials
The [Official Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) is the best resource for getting started with Gatsby and understand the basics.
