**A classical Computation is like a solo voice but Quantum Computation is like a Symphony—many lines of tones interfering with one another.**

The Union of enchanting Quantum Concepts with modern computing is fascinating, isn’t it?
And in order to aid this fascination, Team ISTE at NIT Hamirpur as a part of its Annual Technical Fest, Prodyogiki is here to provide you with insights on Quantum Computing, which would be presented by Roger Luo himself, the Creator of Quantum BFS Ecosystem and a Researcher at the University of Waterloo. His amazing insights on Quantum Computing will allow us to catch a glimpse of this magical world!
From getting to know the basics of Quantum Computing to explaining the opportunities associated with it and finally running your own Quantum Circuit on a real Quantum Computer, we have got it all covered.

So, superimpose your curiosity and enthusiasm and save the date for this illuminating session.

Date and Time: 31st Jan - 11:00 AM IST
