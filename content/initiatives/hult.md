The Hult Prize is an annual, year-long competition that crowd-sources ideas from college students after challenging them to solve a pressing social issue around topics such as food security, water access, energy, and education. It was founded by Ahmad Ashkar and is funded by Bertil Hult, the latter of whom, along with his family – founders of EF Education First – donates US$1 million in seed capital to help the winning team launch a social enterprise.

The Prize is a partnership between Hult International Business School and the United Nations Foundation. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton selects the challenge topic and announces the winner each September. The Hult prize has been referred to as the "Nobel Prize for students" by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.
