Every technocrat’s first hand at practical implementation of what has been learnt, every nerd’s passion and the most fulfilling exploration of technology that any engineer can do. These are merely the glimpses of the gala show that "Prodyogiki" is. We at ISTE, NIT Hamirpur are ready with a chain of events designed to challenge and motivate the students, and bring out their best.

Prodyogiki is filled with interactive technological sessions, workshops, events, quizzes and ample other activities for all you technocrats out there. We promise to be the melting pots of different engineering and technical fields and will set new benchmarks in taking the technological culture of NIT Hamirpur to the unprecedented marks of glory.
